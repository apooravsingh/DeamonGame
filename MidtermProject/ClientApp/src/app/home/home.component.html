    <h2>The rules of the game</h2>
    <p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</p>
    <p>- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score</p>
    <p>- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn</p>
    <p>- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that,
      it's the next player's turn</p>
    <p>- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game</p>
